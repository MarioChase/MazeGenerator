# MazeGenerator

The goal of this is to create a program that generates a maze based off of various Graph Theory Algorithms graphically.
  -Recursive Backtracker
  -Eller's Algorithm
  -Kruskal's Algorithm
  -Prim's algorithm
  -Recursive division Algorithm
  -Hunt-and-Kill algorithm
  -growing tree algorithm
  -Binary tree algorithm
Eventually this can be adapted to translate it to a top down dungeon crawler in similar style to gauntlet.
